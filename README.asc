== Workshop: HTML5 For Java Programmers

The goal this hands-on workshop is to offer a fast-pace introduction to developing the UI for Web Applications using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. While most of the Java developers are familiar with the process of dynamic creation of Web pages using Java Servlets, JavaServer Pages or JavaServer Faces, you can separate development of the application UI and the server-side processing, so the server and the client tiers just send the data to each other.

This 4-hour workshop will teach you how to develop the front-end of Web applications, where a Web Browser makes AJAX calls to consume JSON-formatted data for rendering as HTML views. The workshop will start with an introduction to JavaScript followed by the hands-on work on creating a prototype of the first two pages of the Online Auction application: Home and the Search Results.
