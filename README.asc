== Workshop: HTML5 For Java Programmers

The goal this hands-on workshop is to offer a fast-pace introduction to the development practices of Web Applications, where UI is done using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. While most of the Java developers are familiar with dynamic creation of the Web pages using Java Servlets, JavaServer Pages or JavaServer Faces, the trend is to separate development of the application UI and the server-side processing. The server and the client tiers just send the data to each other.

This 4-hour workshop is about developing the front-end of Web applications where a Web Browser makes Ajax calls to consume JSON-formatted data for rendering as HTML views.  The workshop will start as a fast-pace introduction to JavaScript followed by the work on creating a prototype of the first two pages of the Online Auction application: Home and the Search Results pages.
